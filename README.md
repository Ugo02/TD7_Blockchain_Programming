# Blockchain Programming - Project 7

This project is part of a blockchain programming course where I followed the instructions from the following GitHub repository: [erc721-ux - Hardhat](https://github.com/AymericNoel/erc721-ux/tree/hardhat). After completing the given instructions, I built a ReactJS application that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created a ReactJS application that interacts with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The application allows users to interact with ERC721 tokens, including viewing their details and performing transactions.

### Features:
- View token prices and interact with the smart contract to buy tokens.
- View the list of tokens owned by a user.
- Displays the metadata of the tokens including name, description, and image.

## Technologies Used:
- **ReactJS** for building the user interface.
- **Ethereum & Ethers.js** to interact with the smart contract.
- **Vercel** for deploying the app as a static website.

## Deployment

The application has been deployed as a static website using Vercel. You can access the live version of the app via the following URL:
